####  Dynamic programming :-  It's divide the problem into series of overlapping sub problems.

> **Feature**
> * Optimal sub-structure :- Optimal solution can be constructed from optimal solutions of its subproblems.
> * Overlapping sub problems :- Problem can be broken down into sub problems which are reused several times

> **Pro's**
> * Always gives optimal solution

> **Approaches**
> * Brute force `Complexity => Time : O(2^n) | Space : Unknown`
> * Memoization (Top-Down) `Complexity => Time : O(n) | Space : O(n)`
> * Tabulation (Bottom-Up) `Complexity => Time : O(n) | Space : O(n)`
> * Space optimization `Complexity => Time : O(n) | Space : O(1)`
